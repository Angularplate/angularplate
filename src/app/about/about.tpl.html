    <h2>What is Angularplate?</h2>

    <p class="lead">
        Angularplate is an AngularJS project using best-practices,
        which also makes use of modern, cutting edge technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
        The goal of this project is to provide people either interested in getting into AngularJS or
        those using AngularJS to have a point of reference that they can use when working on their
        own projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        The idea is to provide the AngularJS community with more information and transparency as to
        what other developers in the community are using on their projects and to potentially give
        advice or information to those unsure of the best/potential solution(s) to the problems they
        may face during development.

<section class="about-why">
    <h2>Why on Earth did you make this monstrosity?</h2>

    <p class="lead">To put it simply. I wanted to.</p>

    <p>
        I had looked at other AngularJS guidelines and projects and felt that something had
        been missed/overlooked in regard to methodology, structure, technologies used etc. within
        each of them.
    </p>

    <p>
        As such I felt that with help from the other great projects, guides and resources
        available for AngularJS, that I'd be able to attempt my own best practice project, that both
        I and others would be able to make use of.

<section class="about-who">
    <h2>Who... are... you?</h2>

    <p class="lead">
        Hey, Matt here (Matthew if you prefer) and I'm currently the main contributor and the author
        of the Angularplate project.
    </p>

    <p>
        Angularplate is intended to be a foundation from which people can create their own projects
        and in-turn contribute back to Angularplate itself by finding best-practice solutions to
        problems and to find technologies/methodologies that could be employed within both the
        AngularJS and general web communities.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hope for this project to catch the interest of like-minded developers that can
        contribute great ideas and/or resources to the project and help both the AngularJS and web
        communities in doing so.

<section class="about-how">
    <h2>Enough already, what does this use?</h2>

    <p class="lead">
        In short, the best methodologies, practices and most appropriate technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Angularplate takes best practice methodologies from various sources (structure,
        JavaScript syntax/usage, HTML syntax/usage, etc.) and bundles it with some of the latest
        technologies used today such as
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gulp/GulpJS</li>
        <li>AngularJS</li>
        <li>NodeJS</li>
        <li>Karma</li>
        <li>Bower</li>
        <li>Sass</li>
        <li>Travis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All the technologies used here have a great deal to offer to the project and weren't just
        included on a whim or them being popular at the time of creation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please feel free to put forward or offer any additional technologies that you use or feel
        would be useful for use within this project and specify why (for bonus points and
        clarity).
